## How It Works (Technical Overview)

### Image Processing Pipeline
1. **Upload** → User selects image
2. **Preprocessing** → Image is enhanced for better recognition
   - Convert to grayscale
   - Increase contrast
   - Reduce noise
3. **OCR** → Tesseract reads the letters
4. **Cleanup** → Extract valid letters and organize into grid

### Word Finding Algorithm
```
For each starting position in grid:
  For each of 8 directions (horizontal, vertical, diagonal):
    Check if word matches from this position
    If match found → Store the positions
    Highlight all letters of the word
```
